# typescript-playground

A playground for testing typescript

## For typescript to typecheck and compile your code as you go along

1. terminal command: tsc --init
2. terminal command to compile files: tsc
3. terminal command for watch mode: tsc -w || tsc --watch

## Notes

1. Generics gives you flexibility as well as the type checking protection
